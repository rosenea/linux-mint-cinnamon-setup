# Credit for Icons
Here are the links to where these custom icons where acquired and the person(s)
who made them (if I could find them).

The current icons I am using are Arc-OSX-D and it's required Paper-Mono-Dark. I
am not using the version of Paper-Mono-Dark bundled with the Arc OSX Icons,
instead I am using the versions directly from the creator.

> I still need to find a good way of keeping these up-to-date.
