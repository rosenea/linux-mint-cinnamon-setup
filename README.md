# Linux Setup Scripts

My full setup is getting far to complicated to maintain with the original setup
script. So I created this to perform the non-custom stylistic changes. I am also
keeping a link to the common function scripts in here because I am constantly
needing to use these. My main setup script will include this separately.

This project contains my desired customizations for th Cinnamon flavor of Linux
Mint 18.3 and Debian 9.4 (I haven't tested Debian 9.4 in a little while so I
hope that it is still working correctly).


# Installation
You can perform the installations by either individually running the
installation scripts in this directory, or by including them into another script
using:

```bash
bash /path/to/install_script.sh

# OR

sh /path/to/install_script.sh
```


# Credits
The credits are separated by the type of item they belong too:

* [Cursor Credits](./cursors/CREDIT.md)


# Special Note

I am terrible at writing README documents; but, I am working on it. :)
