# Linux Setup Scripts

My full setup is getting far to complicated to maintain with the original setup
script. So I created this to perform the non-custom stylistic changes. I am also
keeping a link to the common function scripts in here because I am constantly
needing to use these. My main setup script will include this separately.

This project contains my desired customizations for th Cinnamon flavor of Linux
Mint 18.3 and Debian 9.4 (I haven't tested Debian 9.4 in a little while so I
hope that it is still working correctly).


> **NOTE**
> 
> The scripts are all written so they can be called either independently or as
> a function in a different script. This is so for simplicity of usage
> programmatically.


# Credits

This is all work done by others (except for some of the scripting), so a huge
thanks to all whose work I am showcasing:

# Special Note

I am terrible at writing README documents; but, I am working on it. :)
