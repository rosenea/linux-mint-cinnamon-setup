# Credit for Cursors
Here are the links to the where these custom cursors where acquired and the
person who made them (if I could find them).

The current cursor I am using is OpenZone Black Slim. The others where being
used previously; but, are just being kept for historical value.


# Needed Modifications
To get the most consistent behaviour from these themes I had to make the
following changes:

1. Renamed the OpenZone cursor names in their `index.theme` files.
  - This was done to unify the icon with the others I have.
2. Created the `cursor.theme` file in the OpenZone project directories.
  - This was done to unify the process.
